üß≠ AI Browser Extension

A Chrome (Manifest V3) extension that transforms your browser into an AI-powered assistant. It lets you chat with an AI model directly in a side panel, summarize or explain any web page, and even query selected text with a right-click.

‚ú® Current Features
	‚Ä¢	Side Panel Chat
A persistent chat interface that stays open per tab, letting you ask questions or request summaries while you browse.
	‚Ä¢	Page Context Extraction
Reads visible text from the current page or grabs highlighted selections to provide context for AI responses.
	‚Ä¢	Context Menu Integration
Right-click on any text selection and choose ‚ÄúAsk AI about selection‚Äù to instantly send it to the assistant.
	‚Ä¢	Configurable Settings
Options page to set your API base URL, model, and context length (stored in chrome.storage.sync).
	‚Ä¢	Secure Backend Design
Assumes a lightweight proxy backend (Cloudflare Worker, FastAPI, etc.) that safely handles API keys and forwards requests to your AI provider.
	‚Ä¢	MVP Complete
Already supports summarization, explanations, and context-aware Q&A using your chosen AI model.
